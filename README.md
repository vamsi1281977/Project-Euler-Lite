# Project-Euler-Lite
Answers to lite version of Project Euler problems.

This page contains answers to Project Euler problems for parameters easier than the ones at Project Euler, hence the lite. For answers to Project Euler problems, please visit: https://github.com/luckytoilet/projecteuler-solutions.

1. S(n): sum of all multiples of 3 or 5 less than n. S(1000) = 233168.
2. S(n): sum of even fibonacci numbers not greater than n. S(4000000) = 4613732.
3. lgpf(n): largest prime factor of n. lgpf(600851475143) = 6857.
4. The largest palindromic number that is a product of two three digit numbers is 906609.
5. lcm(1,2,3,...,20) = 232792560.
6. a(n): sum of the first n positive integers = (n * (n + 1)) / 2, b(n): sum of the squares of the first n positive integers = (n * (n + 1) * (n + n + 1)) / 6, (a(100) ** 2) - b(100) = 25164150.
7. This problem can be solved using a variation of Lucy Hedgehog's algorithm for Problem 10. Prime(10001) = 104743.
8. Largest product of 13 contiguous digits is 23514624000.
9. The Pythagorean triple with a + b + c = p = 1000 is (200, 375, 425) = 25 * (8, 15, 17). abc = 31875000.
10. Lucy Hedgehog has the best answer to this problem. The Lucy Hedgehog algorithm can be modified to compute Prime_Pi(x). The Prime_Pi(x) can be used to solve problem 7. S(x): sum of all primes not greater than x, S(2000000) = 142913828922.
